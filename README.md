#### Trends:


Overall the average reading scores are higher than the average math scores for students of all grade levels. The average reading scores are all in the 80s while the average math scores range from the mid/higher 70s to lower/mid 80s. We can see that the best scores come from schools that spend less than $615 per student rather than more. Schools with less than 2000 students also perform better than schools with a larger student population. Based on the data, we can also conclude that charter schools tend to have better performance in all categories than district schools. These charter schools have a smaller school size than district schools and have a lower per student budget as well, and their students have significantly higher passing rates than district school students.
